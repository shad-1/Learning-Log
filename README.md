## Angular
- When working with a component from a package, don't treat the package like a black box. Find the code wherever it's hosted and figure out how it works. IOW `F12` everything. (11/11/21)

## Debugging
- If a parent component is not recieving the expected information from the child, dig into the way that the child is working. Odds are an event isn't being fired. (11/2/21)
- If you're not sure why properties on an object are the way that they are, check the DB to see if other instances/versions of that object have matching properties. If not, you might be dealing with bad data. (11/12/21)
